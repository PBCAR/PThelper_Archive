Description: A series of functions that introduce the steps needed to: i) Pre-process raw purchase task data; ii) Calculate empirical indices and 
    derived values via equation; iii) Manage index-level indices; and iv) Summarize purchase task indices. Pre-processing includes detecting non-systematic 
    data using criteria set forth by Stein et al. (2015). These criteria are customizable for the user, and can accommodate purchase tasks (henceforth PTs) 
    that are partially administered, such as those administered using an array system or until zero-consumption is reached. Empirically-derived PT indices 
    (Intensity, Breakpoint, Omax, Pmax) can be calculated from the data directly, as can equation-derived PT indices (alpha, eta, Q0, unit elasticity) using 
    either the exponentiated demand equation (Koffarnus et al., 2015), or a linear equation.
