Description: This package introduces a series of steps needed to clean, process, and use purchase task data. The PThelper package consists of 10 different functions
    to walk users through 3 different stages of purchase task processing: i) The pre-processing stage of the raw data; ii) The calculation of empirical indices and 
    alpha via curve-fitting; and iii) The index-level purchase task variable management.
