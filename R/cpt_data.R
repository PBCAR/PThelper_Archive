#' CPT_DATA
#'
#' A mock data set of a Cigarette Purchase Task (CPT), consisting of 15 items in total. The prices range from 'FREE ($0)'
#' to '$10' per cigarette. Specifically: c("0","0.05","0.10","0.20","0.30","0.40","0.50","0.75","1","2","3","4","5","7.5","10").
#' The items are administered to participants in arrays of 3. A zero consumption response within an array will end the instrument
#' after the final item within the array. Thus, this is an example of a partially-administered purchase task.
