\usage{
pt_auc(pt, id_var, type, qmax = NULL, group_var = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pt}{A data frame consisting of the `id_var` and purchase task variables.}

\item{id_var}{The name of the unique identifier as identified in the data frame.}

\item{type}{The level for fitting the demand curves, one of c("overall","group","individual"). The default is "overall" which will calculate
overall demand for the entire data frame. For `type` "group", equation-derived demand indicators for each of the groups as identified by the `group_var`
are visualized. When `type` equals "individual", equation-derived demand indicators are calculated for each individual as identified by `id_var`.}

\item{qmax}{The maximum consumption amount possible on the purchase task. This must be provided in order to calculate AUC proportionately.}

\item{group_var}{The name of the grouping variable when `type` equals "group".}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 graphical object; For `type` "individual", the original pt data frame plus the derived values for each individual is returned.
}
\description{
This function calculates the area under the curve (AUC). See details for additional information.
}
\details{
The use of AUC as a measure of demand was proposed by Amlung et al., (2015), and is derived by calculating the area of several
trapezoids under the empirical consumption curve. The area of each trapazoid is calculated by the formula (p2 âˆ’ p1)*[(q2 + q1)/ 2].
Here, p2 and p1 are price p and price p - 1, whilst and q2 and q1 are consumption q at price p and price p - 1. The AUC is expressed
as a proportion of the total area (range from 0 to 1), allowing for comparison across different purchase tasks or samples.

### --- Load Data
data("cpt_data")

### --- Prep Data
pt <- price_prep(cpt_data, id_var = "ID", vars = c(paste0("cpt",1:15)),
prices = c("0","0.05","0.10","0.20","0.30","0.40","0.50", "0.75","1","2","3","4","5","7.5","10"))

pt2 <- pt_prep(pt, id_var = "ID", remove0 = TRUE, max_val = 99)
pt3 <- pt_qc(pt2, id_var = "ID", type = "partial")

### --- Function Example
pt4 <- pt_auc(pt3$data, id_var = "ID", type = "individual", qmax = 99)

}
